The clear conclusion from this data visualization is that across all cocktails
on the menu, Rye and Gin are featured over any other alcoholic ingredient.

This repository includes a final version with 'Type' used as a variable 
(union_chart_final.html) and another version that does not include 'Type' 
as a variable (union_chart_sixth). That version is a bit cleaner, but lacks 
information that I felt I needed based on feedback. The previous versions are 
all drafts saved working up to these two final charts. 

The dataset was created by me. It lists all the cocktails served at Union Lodge #1 
in Denver, Colorado that are in the menu. I bartend at there. The data set includes
the name of the cocktail, each liquid ingredient used in the drink, the volume of that 
ingredient used in ounces and mL, and an explanatory categorical variable called 'Type'. 
 
Union Lodge #1 is pre-prohibition focused cocktail bar, so not only does this 
list serve to give a snapshot of what we specialize in, but also shows the types of cocktails 
that were most prevalant in the mid 1800's to early 1900's. We put a lot of house spins on these
classics though. For example, you wouldn't have found cherry hazelnut bitters in a Manhattan or 
Sloe Gin in a Ramos GinFizz. 

Although this data could be used as a reference to make these cocktails, I wouldn't encourage
it as I have only listed liquid ingredients. For example, if you tried to use this data to
make our Old Fashioned you would be missing the lemon peel and demerara sugar cube we muddle
with the bitters and a bit of soda and the hand cut cube we put in the cocktail. If you are 
a bartender or cocktail enthusiast you know that technique, tools, ice, garnish, etc. are 
as important as the ingredients. All that said, with a working knowledge of cocktails, 
this data could be of help to put together a nice cocktail! Go for the gold!
