The clear conclusion from the data visualization included in this repository is that across all cocktails
on the menu at Union Lodge #1, Gin and Rye are featured over any other alcoholic ingredient. 
Carbonated Water is featured over any non-alcoholic ingredient. 

Union Lodge #1 is a pre-prohibition focused cocktail bar. For those that are 
cocktail enthusiast, or even those who fancy a drink every so often, the takeaway
from this visual might be interesting. As a bartender, I find many people do not have a lot of
experience with gin or are turned off to the spirit, however it was prominently used in
many early cocktail recipes. With the resurgence of bourbon over the past
decade, one might be surprised to find that rye was most often used for cocktails during
the pre-prohibition era. It might also interesting to see carbonated water's influence
on pre-prohibition cocktails, used in classics such as the Gin and Tonic, Tom Collins,
and the Ramos Gin Fizz. 

A viewer that is interested can easily dig deeper for secondary conclusions (if they wish), 
such as which citrus is represented more than any other (lemon) or which bitters (Angostura).
They can also see what is not present (for example vodka), as it was not used in any 
American pre-prohibition cocktail recipes.

This repository includes a final version titled (union_chart_final.html) 
The previous versions are all drafts saved working up to the final charts. 

The dataset was created by me. It lists all the cocktails served at Union Lodge #1 
in Denver, Colorado that are in the menu. The data set includes
the name of the cocktail, each liquid ingredient used in the drink, the volume of that 
ingredient used in ounces and mL, and an explanatory categorical variable called 'Type'. 

Although this data could be used as a reference to make these cocktails, I wouldn't encourage
it as I have only listed liquid ingredients. For example, if you tried to use this data to
make our Old Fashioned you would be missing the lemon peel and demerara sugar cube we muddle
with the bitters and a bit of soda and the hand cut cube we put in the cocktail. If you are 
a bartender or cocktail enthusiast you know that technique, tools, ice, garnish, etc. are 
as important as the ingredients. All that said, with a working knowledge of cocktails, 
this data could be of help to put together a nice cocktail! Go for the gold!
